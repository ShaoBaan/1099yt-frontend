# 1099yt-frontend

1. The frontend development environment is "webpack + babel + react".
2. For now (09/07/2018) the project only contains the code of a tutorial from react.js documentation.
3. To run the code, execute command "npm install" at the root the project directory, given that you've cloned the code to your computer.
4. If all the node_modules(dependencies) are installed successfully, execute command "npm start" at the root of the project directory.
5. Now a local sever should be running and you're be able to visit it at "http://localhost:3000".
